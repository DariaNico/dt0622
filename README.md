# dt0622
Welcome to my Java Demo Project mocking a tool rental system.

* To run tests:
    * Go to `dt0622/the-tool-rental/` directory in console
    * then run:
        ```
        mvn test
        ```

* To run the application:
    * Go to `dt0622/the-tool-rental/` directory in console
    * then run:
        ```
        mvn spring-boot:run
        ```
    * A very basic site will be running in `http://localhost:8081/` and you can access the database console at `http://localhost:8081/h2-db`

## Notes
Please note that there is only a backend to this project so far and only a shim page for the frontend. Feel free to fork it over and make your own adjustments!
