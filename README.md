Welcome to my Java Demo Project mocking a tool rental system.

* To run tests:
```
mvn test
```

* To run the application:
```
mvn spring-boot:run
```
    * A very basic site will be running in `http://localhost:8081/` and you can access the database console at `http://localhost:8081/h2-db`

## Notes
Please note that there is only a backend to this project so far and only a shim page for the frontend. Feel free to fork it over and make your own adjustments!
